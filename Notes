Q: WAPP to print +2 for every number from 1 to 10.

A:
1. range(1,11) ---> 1,2,3,...,10
2. for loop (i)
3. res = i+2
4. print(res)


Q: WAPP to check whether the given input is prime or not.
A:

1. take a input
2. prime - a number which is completely divisible(n%i==0) by 1 and n(itself)
    1. for loop - 1 to n - range(1,n+1)
    2. if condition - n%i==0



While Loop:
    start and end -- for loop
    start or only the ending point means the range is not known

    untill i complete 10 rounds ill not stop running

    round = 0
    while round != 10:
        running
        round = round + 1

    completed 10 rounds

Assignment:

ATM:
    1.deposit
    3.withdrawal
    5.balance check

    Steps:
        1. Enter the card
        2. Enter the pin
        3. print menu
        4. select an option
            1. balance:
                1. show balance
                2. continue or exit
                    1. continue - go to step 2
                    2. exit - exit note(thank you)

            2. deposit: (balance + money)
                1. Enter the money to deposit
                2. continue or exit

                    2. exit - exit note

Assignment:
    1. If necessary make changes in the pin checking
    2. pin should be entered only for 3 times
    3. write the complete program


Break and Continue:
    1. Break it will stop the loop
    2. Continue it will skip the current iteration and continue with the loop

    for i in range(1,10):
        if i == 5:
            continue


ATM:
    1. limit pin length to 4
    2. pin should be only digits

isdigit() :
    in a string it will check whether all the characters are numbers

List:
    A collection of one or more heterogeneous elements in called as List.
    [1,"mounish",True,1.3]
    1. ordered
    2. duplicate values

    def:
        A collection of heterogeneous elements which are ordered and accepts duplicate
        values is called a list.

#Assignment:

1. Print pattern -> input: "mounish"
    m
    mo
    mou
    moun
    mouni
    mounis
    mounish

2. In a list -> [1,2,3,4,5,6] print the even position values
3. In a list -> [1,2,3,4,5,6] print the odd values
4. In a string "Python Programming" replace O with R
5. In a list -> [2,5,3,2,5,6]
    if the element is even make it odd by adding 1
    if the element is odd make it even by adding 1
